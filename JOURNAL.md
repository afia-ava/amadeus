## Entry 3
Now that I have the main container base done, I'm trying to find the CAD models step files to include in my design. I have found both the Rasberry Pi 5 and Halio AI top model on GeabCAD. I added an extra wall quite in the center of the container (as the surface outside is of arc shaped) to add wall mounting for the boards. I have added the wall mount holes, as well as empty space in the bottom for the cables. 

## Entry 2
I have the initial version of the threaded container. It's my first time working on a CAD project moving from tinkercad to fusion 360. It definitely has a lot of extra features but I've been overwheled with too many options. But afterall, I was able to build up the threaded container and I hope it will work! 

## Entry 1 
Up until now, I've worked on researching about compatible components that can be used to build Amadeus. So far I've the potential list and will be working on a designing a CAD file modelling a cylindrical container that can hold all the necessary components. The reason I'm leaning towards a container is that if the device has a threaded opening then it will be easy to do troubleshooting.
