## Entry 5
I have added 3 cameras and wall mounting for each of them. A good reminder is to make the new sketches as new bodies instead of joining them for more flexibility. I had to redo mine for joining it earlier and even though I looked into making curved surface to split the body, it didn't work for me when I tried. Later after a lot of redo manual work, I was able to get all three of the camera placed well at angular positions so that it's 120 degrees away from each other. 

## Entry 4
I have gathered pretty much all the CAD models from GrabCAD and Printables. I was not able to find the microphone array CAD model similar to mine, so I modelled one with similar dimensions as a placeholder. One of the problem is I downloaded most of the files is STEP format, but I can only seem to import STL files. I didn't find a lot of good converters online, with one convert 3d has time resets on the free version. I assume there's more but it looked complicated enough that I will dig into it at a different time. 

## Entry 3
Now that I have the main container base done, I'm trying to find the CAD models step files to include in my design. I have found both the Rasberry Pi 5 and Halio AI top model on GeabCAD. I added an extra wall quite in the center of the container (as the surface outside is of arc shaped) to add wall mounting for the boards. I have added the wall mount holes, as well as empty space in the bottom for the cables. 

## Entry 2
I have the initial version of the threaded container. It's my first time working on a CAD project moving from tinkercad to fusion 360. It definitely has a lot of extra features but I've been overwheled with too many options. But afterall, I was able to build up the threaded container and I hope it will work! 

## Entry 1 
Up until now, I've worked on researching about compatible components that can be used to build Amadeus. So far I've the potential list and will be working on a designing a CAD file modelling a cylindrical container that can hold all the necessary components. The reason I'm leaning towards a container is that if the device has a threaded opening then it will be easy to do troubleshooting.
